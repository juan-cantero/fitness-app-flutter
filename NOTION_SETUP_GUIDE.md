# Notion Integration Guide

## How to Import the Project Backlog into Notion

### Option 1: CSV Import (Recommended)

1. **Create a new Notion database**
   - Open Notion and create a new page
   - Add a "Database" block
   - Choose "Table" view

2. **Import the CSV file**
   - Click the "..." menu in your database
   - Select "Import"
   - Upload the `NOTION_IMPORT.csv` file from this repository
   - Map the columns appropriately

3. **Configure database properties**
   - **Task** (Title) - The main task description
   - **Epic** (Select) - The feature epic this task belongs to
   - **Priority** (Select) - High, Medium, Low
   - **Status** (Select) - Not Started, In Progress, Completed
   - **Agent** (Select) - Which development agent to use
   - **Description** (Text) - Detailed task description
   - **Acceptance Criteria** (Text) - What defines completion

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If you prefer to set up the database manually:

1. **Create database with these properties:**
   ```
   - Task (Title)
   - Epic (Select: Foundation, Authentication, Database, Exercise Management, 
     Workout Management, AI Intelligence, User Profile, Analytics, UI/UX, Testing, Deployment)
   - Priority (Select: High, Medium, Low)
   - Status (Select: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
   - Agent (Select: Database Architecture Agent, Security & Privacy Agent, 
     API Integration Agent, Flutter State Management Agent, LLM Intelligence Agent,
     Testing & Quality Agent, Documentation Agent)
   - Description (Text)
   - Acceptance Criteria (Text)
   - Estimated Hours (Number)
   - Assigned To (Person)
   - Due Date (Date)
   - Dependencies (Relation)
   ```

2. **Copy tasks from PROJECT_BACKLOG.md**
   - Use the markdown file as reference to populate your database

### Option 3: Using Notion API (Advanced)

If you want to automate the import:

1. **Get Notion API access**
   - Go to https://www.notion.so/my-integrations
   - Create a new integration
   - Get your API token

2. **Create import script** (example in Python):
   ```python
   import csv
   import requests

   # Read the CSV and use Notion API to create entries
   # (Full script would require proper API setup)
   ```

## Recommended Notion Views

### 1. **Kanban Board by Status**
- Group by: Status
- Filter: Show all tasks
- Sort: Priority (High â†’ Low)

### 2. **Epic Planning View**
- Group by: Epic
- Filter: Status != Completed
- Sort: Priority, then Agent

### 3. **Agent Assignment View**
- Group by: Agent
- Filter: Status = Not Started OR In Progress
- Sort: Priority

### 4. **Sprint Planning**
- Filter: Status = Not Started
- Sort: Priority, Dependencies
- Add: Estimated Hours property

## Usage Tips

### 1. **Start with High Priority Foundation Tasks**
Begin with Database Architecture and Authentication tasks as they're dependencies for most other features.

### 2. **Use Agent-Based Development**
When working on tasks, use the specified development agent:
```bash
claude-code task --agent="agents/[agent_name].md" "[task description]"
```

### 3. **Track Dependencies**
Some tasks depend on others. For example:
- Database schema must be completed before repositories
- Authentication must work before user-specific features
- Models must exist before UI screens that use them

### 4. **Update Status Regularly**
Keep the Notion database updated with:
- Progress updates
- Blockers encountered
- Actual time spent
- Notes and learnings

## Notion Template

You can also create a Notion template with the structure already set up. Here's a template you can duplicate:

**[Template Link]** - You would need to create this in your Notion workspace and copy the database structure.

## Integration with Development

### Daily Workflow
1. Check Notion for next priority task
2. Assign task to yourself
3. Use the specified development agent with Claude Code
4. Update task status and add notes
5. Create commits referencing the task
6. Mark task as completed when done

### Sprint Planning
- Filter tasks by priority and dependencies
- Estimate effort for each task
- Plan sprints based on agent expertise needed
- Track velocity and adjust planning

## Alternative Project Management Tools

The same backlog can be imported into other tools:

### Trello
- Convert epics to boards
- Convert tasks to cards
- Use labels for priority and agent assignment

### Jira
- Create epics as Jira epics
- Import tasks as stories
- Use components for agent assignment

### GitHub Projects
- Use the built-in project board
- Convert tasks to GitHub issues
- Use labels for categorization

### Linear
- Import as initiatives and tasks
- Use teams for agent assignment
- Track progress with cycles

The CSV format is designed to be compatible with most project management tools that support CSV import.
