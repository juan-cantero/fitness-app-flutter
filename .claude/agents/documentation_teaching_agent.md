### Code Documentation Template
```dart
/// Service responsible for managing workout data and business logic.
/// 
/// This service handles:
/// - Workout CRUD operations
/// - LLM-powered workout generation
/// - Offline synchronization
/// - User preference integration
/// 
/// Usage example:
/// ```dart
/// final workoutService = WorkoutService();
/// final workout = await workoutService.generateWorkout(context);
/// ```
/// 
/// See also:
/// - [WorkoutRepository] for data persistence
/// - [LLMService] for AI-powered features
/// - [SyncManager] for offline handling
class WorkoutService {
  /// Creates a new workout service with required dependencies.
  /// 
  /// [repository] handles data persistence operations
  /// [llmService] provides AI-powered workout generation
  /// [syncManager] handles offline synchronization
  WorkoutService({
    required this.repository,
    required this.llmService,
    required this.syncManager,
  });

  /// Generates a personalized workout based on user context.
  /// 
  /// Takes into account:
  /// - Available time and equipment
  /// - Fitness level and preferences
  /// - Recent workout history
  /// - Target muscle groups
  /// 
  /// Returns a [Workout] with exercises, sets, and reps tailored to the user.
  /// 
  /// Throws [WorkoutGenerationException] if generation fails due to:

## Flutter + Supabase Learning Path

### Beginner Level: Foundation
**Tutorial 1: Setting Up Your Flutter Fitness App**
```markdown
# Setting Up Your Flutter Fitness App with Supabase

## What You'll Learn
- Create a new Flutter project optimized for fitness apps
- Integrate Supabase for backend services
- Set up basic project structure and dependencies
- Configure development environment

## Why This Architecture?
We chose Flutter + Supabase because:
- **Single Codebase**: Flutter lets us build for iOS and Android simultaneously
- **Real-time Features**: Supabase provides real-time data synchronization
- **Authentication**: Built-in auth with social providers
- **Scalability**: PostgreSQL database that grows with your app
- **Cost-Effective**: Generous free tier and predictable pricing

## Project Setup

### 1. Create Flutter Project
```bash
flutter create fitness_app_flutter
cd fitness_app_flutter
```

### 2. Add Dependencies
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  supabase_flutter: ^2.0.0
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.0
  go_router: ^12.0.0
  flutter_secure_storage: ^9.0.0
```

**Why These Dependencies?**
- `supabase_flutter`: Official Supabase client for Flutter
- `flutter_riverpod`: State management that scales well
- `go_router`: Declarative routing for better navigation
- `flutter_secure_storage`: Secure token storage

### 3. Supabase Project Setup

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### ADR Template
```markdown
# ADR-001: State Management with Riverpod

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a state management solution that can handle:
- Complex app state with authentication
- Real-time data updates from Supabase
- Offline-first architecture requirements
- Testable and maintainable code

## Decision
We will use Riverpod for state management.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Compile-time safety with providers
- Excellent testing support
- Works well with async operations
- Good performance with selective rebuilds

### Negative
- Learning curve for developers new to Riverpod
- More boilerplate than some alternatives

### Neutral
- Need to establish provider organization patterns
- Requires consistent naming conventions

## Implementation Notes
```dart
// Example provider structure
final authStateProvider = StateNotifierProvider<AuthNotifier, AuthState>((ref) {
  return AuthNotifier(ref.read(supabaseProvider));
});
```

## Alternatives Considered
- **Provider**: Too simple for complex state
- **Bloc**: More verbose, harder to test
- **GetX**: Less type-safe, more magic

## References
- [Riverpod Documentation](https://riverpod.dev)
- [Flutter State Management Comparison](...)
```

## Interactive Learning Examples

### Supabase Integration Workshop
```dart
/// Interactive example: Building your first Supabase query
/// 
/// This example walks through connecting to Supabase and fetching data.
/// Try modifying the query to see different results!

class SupabaseLearningExample {
  final SupabaseClient supabase = Supabase.instance.client;
  
  /// EXERCISE 1: Fetch all public exercises
  /// 
  /// Goal: Understand basic SELECT operations
  /// 
  /// Try these modifications:
  /// 1. Add a WHERE clause to filter by category
  /// 2. Add ORDER BY to sort results
  /// 3. Add LIMIT to restrict results
  Future<List<Exercise>> fetchPublicExercises() async {
    // YOUR CODE HERE:
    // Replace this comment with a Supabase query
    
    // SOLUTION:
    final response = await supabase
        .from('exercises')
        .select('*')
        .eq('is_public', true)
        .order('created_at', ascending: false)
        .limit(10);
    
    return response.map((json) => Exercise.fromJson(json)).toList();
  }
  
  /// EXERCISE 2: Insert a new exercise with error handling
  /// 
  /// Goal: Learn INSERT operations and error handling
  /// 
  /// Requirements:
  /// 1. Insert the exercise data
  /// 2. Handle potential errors (duplicate names, validation)
  /// 3. Return the created exercise with its new ID
  Future<Exercise> createExercise(Exercise exercise) async {
    // YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
    
    // Hints:
    // - Use .insert() method
    // - Add .select() to get the created record back
    // - Wrap in try-catch for error handling
    // - Check for specific error types (duplicate_key, etc.)
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guides

### Common Flutter + Supabase Issues
```markdown
# Common Issues and Solutions

## Issue: "Invalid JWT" Error

### Problem
```
SupabaseException: Invalid JWT
```

### Cause
- Expired session token
- Token stored incorrectly
- Authentication state not properly managed

### Solution
```dart
// Implement automatic token refresh
class AuthService {
  Future<void> initializeAuth() async {
    // Check for existing session
    final session = supabase.auth.currentSession;
    
    if (session?.isExpired ?? false) {
      // Attempt to refresh
      try {
        await supabase.auth.refreshSession();
      } catch (e) {
        // Redirect to login
        await signOut();
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Prevention
- Always check session validity before API calls
- Implement automatic refresh logic
- Handle auth state changes properly

## Issue: Slow List Performance

### Problem
ListView with many items becomes sluggish

### Solution
```dart
// Use ListView.builder for better performance
ListView.builder(
  itemCount: items.length,
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    return ListTile(
      title: Text(items[index].name),
      // Keep widgets simple and avoid complex layouts
    );
  },
)
```

### Additional Optimizations
- Implement pagination for large datasets
- Use const constructors where possible
- Avoid rebuilding expensive widgets
```

## Assessment and Practice

### Knowledge Check Quizzes
```markdown
## Quiz: Supabase Row Level Security

1. What is the purpose of RLS policies?
   a) Speed up database queries
   b) Control data access at the row level
   c) Encrypt data in the database
   d) Backup database automatically

2. Which policy allows users to see only their own workouts?
   ```sql
   a) CREATE POLICY "workouts" ON workouts FOR ALL USING (true);
   b) CREATE POLICY "workouts" ON workouts FOR ALL USING (created_by = auth.uid());
   c) CREATE POLICY "workouts" ON workouts FOR SELECT USING (is_public = true);
   ```

3. How do you enable RLS on a table?
   [Fill in the blank]

### Answers
1. b) Control data access at the row level
2. b) CREATE POLICY "workouts" ON workouts FOR ALL USING (created_by = auth.uid());
3. ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Practical Exercises
```markdown
## Exercise: Build a Custom Exercise Filter

### Requirements
1. Create a widget that filters exercises by:
   - Equipment type (dropdown)
   - Muscle group (multi-select chips)
   - Difficulty level (slider)

2. Implement the filtering logic using Riverpod providers

3. Add persistence so filters survive app restarts

### Starter Code
```dart
class ExerciseFilter {
  final List<String> equipment;
  final List<String> muscleGroups;
  final int difficultyLevel;
  
  // YOUR IMPLEMENTATION HERE
}
```

### Evaluation Criteria
- [ ] All filter types work correctly
- [ ] State is managed properly with Riverpod
