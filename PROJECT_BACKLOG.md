## Notes
- **Agent Assignment**: Each task includes the recommended development agent to use
- **Priority Levels**: HIGH (must-have), MEDIUM (should-have), LOW (nice-to-have)
- **Dependencies**: Some tasks depend on completion of others (e.g., database schema before repositories)
- **Estimation**: Tasks are sized for 1-3 days of development work each

## Usage with Development Agents
For each task, use the specified agent with Claude Code's Task tool:
```bash
claude-code task --agent="agents/[agent_name].md" "[task description]"
```
